The analytical part of this thesis examines the problem domain of Linux From Scratch build automation, evaluates existing solutions, and establishes technical requirements for a modernized cloud-native system. This analysis forms the foundation for subsequent design and implementation decisions.

This chapter is structured into three main sections. Section 1.1 characterizes the problem area by examining the LFS build methodology, its educational context, current challenges faced by users, and the external technological environment. Section 1.2 analyzes information flows in both manual LFS builds and existing automation tools, identifying functional requirements and user qualification needs. Section 1.3 addresses requirements specification and technology selection, comparing alternative tools and platforms against defined criteria to justify the chosen technology stack.

The analytical approach combines literature review of LFS documentation, comparative analysis of automation tools (ALFS, jhalfs), and evaluation of containerization and cloud computing technologies. This systematic analysis establishes the technical and functional requirements that guide the system design presented in subsequent chapters.
