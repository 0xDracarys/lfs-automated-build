# 08. Chapter Summary

The software implementation chapter demonstrates how each system component—database, UI, backend logic, and testing—collectively fulfills the thesis objectives of automation, reproducibility, real-time observability, and accessibility (Beekmans & Burgess, 2023; Google Cloud, 2024; Firebase, 2024; Vercel Inc., 2024).

Challenges included integrating asynchronous cloud workflows, ensuring secure multi-user access, and maintaining high reliability under load. Each architectural choice is justified by reference to best practices and technical documentation (see references).

Future work includes expanding support for ARM64 builds, adding advanced analytics, and further improving accessibility.
