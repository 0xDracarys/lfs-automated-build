# Getting Started with LFS Learning Platform

Welcome to the **LFS Learning Platform** - your comprehensive guide to building Linux From Scratch! 🚀

## What is Linux From Scratch?

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.

### Why Learn LFS?

- **Deep Understanding**: Learn exactly how a Linux system works from the ground up
- **Complete Control**: Build a system tailored to your exact needs
- **Educational Value**: Understand package management, compilation, and system architecture
- **Career Skills**: Gain expertise valued by employers in DevOps, systems engineering, and beyond

## Platform Features

Our platform provides:

1. **Interactive Learning Modules** - Step-by-step lessons with hands-on exercises
2. **Real Terminal Access** - Practice commands in a safe, isolated environment
3. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor your learning journey
4. **Build System** - Automated LFS build pipeline
5. **Community Support** - Learn alongside other Linux enthusiasts

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Account

Sign up to save your progress and access all features:

```bash
# Visit /signup to create your account
# Or use Google Sign-In for quick access
```

### 2. Complete Your Profile

Tell us about your experience level so we can customize your learning path.

### 3. Start Learning

Begin with our **Fundamentals** module to get oriented, or jump right into specific topics:

- **Basic Commands** - Master the Linux command line
- **File Systems** - Understand how Linux organizes data
- **Package Management** - Learn to compile and manage software
- **System Configuration** - Configure your Linux system
- **Kernel Development** - Build and customize the Linux kernel
- **Advanced Topics** - Security, networking, and more

## Learning Path

We recommend following this progression:

    A[Fundamentals] --> B[Basic Commands]
    B --> C[File Systems]
    C --> D[Package Management]
    D --> E[System Configuration]
    E --> F[Kernel Development]
    F --> G[Advanced Topics]
```

### Estimated Time

- **Fundamentals**: 2-3 hours
- **Basic Commands**: 4-5 hours
- **File Systems**: 3-4 hours
- **Package Management**: 5-6 hours
- **System Configuration**: 6-8 hours
- **Kernel Development**: 8-10 hours
- **Advanced Topics**: 10+ hours

**Total**: Approximately 40-50 hours to complete all modules

## Interactive Terminal

One of our most powerful features is the integrated terminal. Try these commands:

```bash
# Check system information
uname -a

# List directory contents
ls -lah

# Check disk usage
df -h

# View running processes
ps aux
```

Each command page includes a **"Try in Terminal"** button that opens a pre-configured terminal with the command ready to run.

## Build Your First LFS System

Once you've completed the core modules, you can use our automated build system to create your first LFS system:

1. Navigate to the **Build** page
2. Configure your build parameters
3. Launch the build
4. Monitor progress in real-time
5. Download your completed system
